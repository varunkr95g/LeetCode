difference between lists and string

lista=listb.sort()

won't work.

you have to perform listb.sort()
and loop through and assign the elements.

but str_lower=str.lower() will work.

This is because lists are mutable. 
and strings are immutable.

Mutable means object can be changed after it's created. 
for example, list

String is immutable -> object can;t be changed after it's creation.
example, string


Id	FullName			Age
1	Bart Thompson		43
2	Catherine Anderson	44
3	John Burkin			35
4	Nicole McGregor		29

select start.id,start.FullName,start.age,paired.Id, paired.FullName
from Colleagues start, Colleagues paired
where start.Id<>paired.Id


select Human.Id,Human.FirstName, Human.Age, Ancestor.Id,Ancestor.FirstName,Ancestor.Age
from Human, Human Ancestor
where Human.ParentId<= Ancestor.Id


select distinct starttime from cd.bookings bk
inner join cd.members mem
on bk.memid=bk.memid
where mem.firstname='David' and mem.surname='Farrell'
order by starttime

select cnt67.salary from
( select tbl.salary, dense_rank() over( order by Sal desc) as dr )
cnt67 where cnt67.dr<=3;
