Why Cloud computing ?

Cloud computing provides basically 2 things:
	1. Compute power
	2. Storage. 

Both of these can be increased as and when required and we pay only for that.	




The certificate I'm aiming for DP-900 Azure Data Fundamentals.

I'm following the contents from the Microsoft Azure official documentation. 
Not following Pluralsight!!!!

First Certificate: DP-900 Azure Data Fundamentals.

It has 4 learning paths:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/learn/certifications/exams/dp-900?tab=tab-learning-paths

The first learning path is 
Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals: Explore core data concepts


Module 1 -> Explore core data concepts
======================================
Data -> collection of facts.
Types of data:
1. Structured - Typically tabular data in form of rows and columns. DBs that hold
tables are called Relational database. Each row in table has same set of columns.

2. Semi-structured - Doesn't reside in relational DB but has some structure to it.
Example -> JSON, key-value stores, graph databases

3. Unstructured -> Audio, video and binary data files. No structure to it.

How is data defined, stored and accessed in cloud computing ?????

Structured data is stored in SQL Server or Azure SQL database. Azure SQL database is 
used to create and access relational tables. The act of setting up a database server is called
Provisioning.

Unstructured data is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
Semi-structured data is stored in Azure Cosmos DB.

Different levels of access which can be configured:
1. Read Only access -> Users can only read data
2. Read/Write Access -> view and modify the data.
3. Owner privilege -> Full access including adding users and removing access to existing users 



Describe data processing solutions !!

Transactional System

A transactional system records transactions. Transaction is a small,discrete unit of work.
Movement of money b/w bank accounts is an example of transaction.
Transactional systems are high volume and data has too be accesible quickly.
The work performed by the transactional system is called OLTP  ( Online Transactional Processing)

To support fast processing, data gets divided into smaller chunks. This means only the particular
columns required for a transaction are available. This leads to creation of multiple 
tables and this is referred to as normalized data.

The disadvantage of it is, to get an overall picture, lot of joins need to be performed,
which might lead to poor performance.



Analytical System


Supports business users who query data and get the big picture of the information.
Capture data and generate insights.

4 processes involved in data processing systems:

1. Data Ingestion -> capturing the raw data. Can come from various sources. This data needs
to be stored in a repository of some sort. It could be a file, database or a relational database.

2. Data Processing / Data Transformation -> 

3. Data Querying

4. Data Visualization -> Power BI


Describe the characteristics of relational and non-relational data!!!

One of the disadvantages for storing data in relational DB would be the necessity of 
normalization. To ensure that the data is stored accurately multiples tables will be 
required. Then, to do an overall analysis, expensive joins will be required.

Refer to the example here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/learn/modules/explore-core-data-concepts/3-identify-types-storage

Non-relational DBs are more helpful in the flexibility they provide and the entire data might
be stored as key-value pairs. One of the disadvantages of Non-relational DBs would be 
id 2 customers had the same address, their values will be entered twice leading to data duplication
and if address needs to be updated, it will be done at 2 locations.


Describe transactional workloads!!!

Relational DBs handle transactional processing. A transaction is a sequence of operations 
that are atomic. Either the sequence succeeds or if something goes wrong, all operations
run so far must be undone.

At the end, wither everything is successful or it's returned back to the starting point.
A transactional database must adhere to the ACID properties.

 
Atomicity -> each transaction either completes successfully or fails completely. 

Consistency -> each transaction takes the data from 1 valid state to another.Should never lose
or create data in a manner that can't be accounted for.

Isolation -> ensures concurrent execution of the transaction leaves the DB in the 
same state if transactions are executed sequentially.

Durability -> Once the transaction is committed, it remains committed despite any power outage
or other factors.

Transactional systems are complex, need to manage multiple users concurrently.
Locks are introduced when 1 user updates a DB so that another user can't read it.
However, extensive locaking will lead to poor performance.

A distributed database is a database wherein data is stored over different physical locations.
A data update to a distributed database will take more time than non-distributed DB.
locks maybe required for transactional consistency for a long time.

To counter this, a concept of eventual consistency is utilised. There's a common server
which knows all the data updates ( adds/deletes) and then it's propogated to various DBs, it might lead to 
inconsistency of the data, but it'll have low latency. It's used in 
social media websites for displaying the count of likes & shares.   	


Describe analytical workloads!!!

Analytical systems are read only system which store huge volumes of data. Used for
data analysis and decision making.



Describe the difference between batch and streaming data

If the data is processed as it arrives, then it's streaming.
If the data is buffered into a group and the group is then processed then it's batch
processing.

Understand batch processing!!!!!

Newly arriving data elements are collected into a group and the grouped data is then processed.
Regarding when the data is processed, it could be time-based ( hourly/ daily)
or wait for the record count to be a certain value ( 1 mil records processed at a single time)

Advantages of batch processing:
1. Large volumes can be processed.
2. the jobs can be scheduled to run at non-peak hours ( complete usage of the system)

Disadvantages of batch processing: 
1. Time delay b/w the data ingested and getting the results
2. All the batch job data should be available and should be error-free. 
Checks need to be performed to ensure that.


Understand streaming and real-time data!!!!

Data is processed as it arrives. Steaming processes are ideal for time critical operations.
Handling data from a Stock-markets is an example of streaming operation.


Understand differences between batch and streaming data!!!!

1. Data Scope: Batch processing can process all the data, but streaming can process most
recent data ( 30 second window.) 

2. Data Size: Batch processing can handle huge amount of data, streaming handles few records.

3. Perfromance: Batch job latency is few hours, streaming is few secs or millisecs

4. Analysis: Batch job is used for complex analysis, streaming is used for simple response
functions.

 

Module 2: explore roles responsibilities in the world of data
===========================================================

What are the roles in the world of data?
1. Azure Database administrator -> Recovers human-made error, grants privileges, manages
security maintenance of the system. Responsible for the overall availability and consistent
performance of the system.

2. Data Engineer -> ingests, cleans and tranforms the raw data based on the 
business requirements into a consumable form 

3. Data Analyst -> Enables the business to maximise their data assets. Builds models
on the transformed data and does visualizations 


Review tasks and tools for database administration

Manages and organises databases.

Common Administrator tools:
1. Azure Data Studio -> Manage different DB systems.
2. SQL Server Management Studio -> Can generate Transact-SQL (T-SQL)scripts
for all functionality.

Azure Portal is used to manage Azure SQL database. You can create a new DB, increase
it's size, assign VCores and delete the DB once it's not needed.



Module 3: Describe concepts of relational data
=================================================

In a relational database, you model collections of entities from the real world as tables. 
An entity is described as a thing about which information needs to be known or held

Relational databases is commonly used for OLTP. Examples of OLTP that use relational
databases are:
1. Banking
2. eCommerce ( Retail)

Index!!!!!

An index in a table is like an index in a book. It will help us to get the right rows without
scanning the entire table. For example:

select * from table where Col_1=C1

If Col_1 is an index, instead of scanning the entire table, the query will directly go to 
the index and fetch the relevant rows making the output appear quicker.

index has the column value along with a reference to the column value in the table.

However, indexes are not free, they take additional storage and each time an insert, update
or delete the data, indexes must be maintained. If table is read only and updates are not 
frequent, having more indexes is a better operation, but for a OLTP with frequent writes,
having more indexes is not helpful.

Some relational database systems support clustered index. Clustered index physically reorganises
a table by the index key. This can improve the performance further as RDBMS
will not have to follow the reference from the index to get the corresponding row in the table.



Choose the right platform for a relational workload!!!!!!

There are 3 different choices widely
1. On-Premise -> Everything happens at an on-premise cluster. Advantage would be maximum control (peace of mind)
Disadvantages would be difficult to scale, maintenance costs, high capital expenditure
i.e.( To handle more data, higher compute power needs to purchased and added. )

2. IaaS -> Infrastructure as a Service. Basically you're taking an on-premise cluster to
cloud. There'll be no software maintenance done, but scaling up would be easier as
cloud provides the compute power. No need to buy or maintain hardware. Users are responsible
for configuring the software, patching, taking the backups.

The Iaas approach is best for migrations and applications requiring operating system-level
access. 


3. PaaS -> Platform as a Service. Everything is provided by the cloud ( software maintenance)
Only disadvantage would be certain functionalities might not be available due to
security reasons. The underlying operating system and hardware might not be exposed to the user.



Module 4: Describe concepts of non relational data
==========================================================

What are the characteristics of non-relational data???????

Non relational data helpful in storing the data as it arrives. enables us to the store the
data in a very flexible manner. Do not impose a schema on the data. Info stored in the 
natural format. Information of entities is stored in the form of collections/containers
rather than relational tables. 2 entities in a collection can have different set of fields.

Example for non-relational data:

## Customer 1
ID: 1
Name: Mark Hanson
Telephone: [ Home: 1-999-9999999, Business: 1-888-8888888, Cell: 1-777-7777777 ]
Address: [ Home: 121 Main Street, Some City, NY, 10110,
           Business: 87 Big Building, Some City, NY, 10111 ] 

## Customer 2
ID: 2
Title: Mr
Name: Jeff Hay
Telephone: [ Home: 0044-1999-333333, Mobile: 0044-17545-444444 ]
Address: [ UK: 86 High Street, Some Town, A County, GL8888, UK,
           US: 777 7th Street, Another City, CA, 90111 ]
           
           

The application that queries the data must be prepared to parse the info to get the relevant data.

Non-relational database provides proprietary language for querying and managing data.

Non-relational DB use-cases:
1. IoT ( Internet of Things): These generate a lot of data which can be stored quickly and easily 
using non-relational data.
2. Retail and Marketing : Microsoft itself uses non-relational data for Xbox and Microsoft store.
3. Gaming : 
4. Web and Mobile application: 


A relational database restructures the data into a fixed format that is designed to answer specific queries.
When data needs to be ingested very quickly, or the query is unknown and unconstrained, a relational database
can be less suitable than a non-relational database.

What is semi-structured data???????

Semi-structured data is data that contains fields. The fields do not have to be the same in every entity.
Fields are defined on a per entity basis. JSON ( JavaScript Object Notation) is common example.

Other formats are 
1. Avro -> Row-based . Good for compressing data.
2. ORC -> stripe based, extracts only certain subset of data for quick data querying.
Highly compressed. Column-based
3. Parquet -> Columnar. It contains row-groups. Row-groups contain the data for each columns.
Parquet file includes metadata for each row-group. This ensures only the required subset is read
for querying purpose. Extremely good for nested structures.


Describe types of non-relational and NoSQL databases!!!!!!!!

NoSQL -> Not only SQL.

4 categories of NoSQL databases:

1. Key-Value-> Simplest and quickest way to insert and query the data. each data item in a key
store has 2 elements, key and value.key identifies the item and the value holds the data.
the value is opaque to the DBMS. Write operations are restricted to inserts and deletes.
Focus on key-store is to make read and writes very effective, search capability is secondary.
Cosmos DB implements key-value storage using TABLE API!!


2. Document database -> opposite end on NoSQL spectrum compared to key-value storage. Each
document has a unique ID and fields in the document are transparent to the DBMS. Document
contains the entire data of an entity. A single document might contain data spanning over 
multiple tables in RDBMS. 

Document  DBs ingest data faster than relational tables but slower compared to key-value
pairs. The focus of document DB is it's querying capability. Azure Cosmos DB implements
a document DB using Core( SQL ) API!!!!


3. Column family -> entire row of a table becomes a Key Value pair and a single value.
It takes a denormalized approach to structure sparse data.
Example:

CustomerID Title FirstName
1			Mr.		ABC

Column Family
1: Title : Mr.
   FirstName : ABC		

The most widely used column family DBMS is Apache Cassandra. Cosmos DB supports Column family
using the Cassandra API!!!   


4. Graph DBs -> Enables us to store entities along with the relationship that these entities
have with each other. Nodes ( Boxes ) are the entities and edge ( Lines ) show the relationship b/w
the entities. Very to figure out all the DRs of a particular Team Member.
Azure Cosmos DB supports Graph DBs through Gremlin API!!!!



Module 5: Explore Concepts of Data Analytics
=============================================================


Describe data ingestion and processing!!!!


Data ingestion and Data Processing happens

2 data processing mechanisms:

1. ETL -> Extract, Transform and Load. The raw data is retrieved and transformed before it's stored.
Useful for simple and less calculations. Used for data cleaning tasks, deduplicating data
and reformatting contents of individual fields.


2. ELT -> Extract, Load and Transform. Data is stored before being transformed.
 Useful for complex analysis.  It can also receive data from storage perform the 
 transformations and then write the data back to storage.


ETL helps with improved data privacy and compliance and doesn't require specialist skills.

ELT provides data lake support and helps handle huge volumes of data.


Explore data visualization!!!!!

What is reporting??
Reporting is the process of organising data into informational summaries. Reporting 
shows what has happened and analytics tries to explain why it has happened and what you can do about it.

What is business intelligence???

BI refers to technologies, applications and practices for collection, integration , 
analysis and presentation of business info.

What is data visualization????

Graphical representation of information and data. The most popular visulazation tool 
in Azure is Power BI. Power BI helps combine different sources of data and combine it 
into a data model.

Data visualization helps understand the meaning of data rather than looking at data itself.


Explore data analytics!!!!

5 categories of data analytics:

1. Descriptive analytics -> Helps answer questions about what has happened based on historical data.
Example: Report on the financial and sales data of an organization.

2. Diagnostic analytics -> Helps answers questions about why this happened.It supplements the basic 
descriptive analytics.

3. Predictive analytics -> Helps answers questions about what will happen in future.
Neural networks and regression models are an example

4. Prescriptive analytics -> what measures should be taken to achieve a goal or target.
by using insights from predictive analytics, data driven decisions can be made.
Use Machine Learning strategies.

5. Cognitive analytics -> draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions 
based on existing knowledge bases and add these findings back to knowledge base.
It's like a self learning feedback loop. It uses NLP ( Natural Language Processing) to make
sense of previously untapped data sources like product reviews.
